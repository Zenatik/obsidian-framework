## Pure water, fast

The Kiyo water bottle purifies water in as little as 60 seconds, and neutralizes up to 99.99% of bacteria in Deep Clean.

## Sustainable

One Kiyo can eliminate the need for 100 plastic bottles a year, making it good for the planet (and your wallet too).

## Travel-ready

Portable and packable, the Kiyo water bottle gives you easy access to purified water, no matter where you go.

## Pure water at your fingertips

Simply fill up your Kiyo bottle with water from a potable source, screw on the cap, and press the button to activate the UVC purification technology – once for Quick Clean and twice for Deep Clean. Within minutes, you’ll have access to clean, pure drinking water.

## Behind the design

Kiyo’s soft, understated silhouette takes inspiration from handmade artisan pottery, while its gentle curves and stone-like, speckled texture recall smooth pebbles from a riverbed – their edges softened over time by the flow of rushing water.
