Who, What, When, Where, Why and How.  This is a journalist technique I read about on [[Reddit]] on creating Daily Notes. I would like to examine how others are implementing Daily Templates with [[Obsidian]] using this method.

- **Who**: Who was part of my day or a specific event?
- **What**: What significant thing happened?
- **When**: When did it happen?
- **Where**: Where was I?
- **Why**: Why was this important or memorable?
- **How**: How did it happen or how did I respond?
